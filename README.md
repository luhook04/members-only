# members-only

[Live Preview](https://afternoon-everglades-29505.herokuapp.com/)

This express project was created to practice authentication and security tacits, as well as getting more express experience. The app is a message board that only users who are a member can view who wrote the messages and when. However, the message title and text will be available to everyone. There is also the ability for a user to become an admin with the power to delete messages. I did struggle with my form data being sent to the mongoDB server with special characters. I thought this was a url encoding problem, but after many, many hours of research and trial and error, I was left stumped. For now, the app displays some special characters as their entity numbers.
